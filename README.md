# Simple Task manager application

A simple web application, where you can create tasks, mark them as completed and also remove them. The application is a consisting of just a frontend, there is no database, but it can save your tasks with the help of local storage even after the user logs out. It is running in a Docker container and it is deployed on GCP. ([Link](https://task-manager-26qgsko6hq-lz.a.run.app/login))

This application mostly got created because I wanted to try out several technologies, so I combined them in one project. The technologies I used:

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind
- Redux Toolkit
- Docker
- GCP
